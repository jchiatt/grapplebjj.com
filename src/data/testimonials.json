      "content": "I was training in another martial arts gym that's build around a belt system. While I did learn the basics, I didn't like the \"pay to advance\" system. I did a lot of research, and I spoke with many other martial arts practitioners. I told them I don't want to learn a program, but that I want to learn how to fight effectively and proficiently. Many from the law enforcement community pointed me to Grapple. I can't even begin to calculate how many tactic classes I've had. All fall short to your method of instruction. You demonstrate, make sure the class can see all angles, instruct your students to apply the tactic being taught, and follow up with each pair to make sure it's done correctly. Brother, you are an outstanding trainer. You communicate well and have a passion for what you do. Don't change a thing. The only feedback I have is gratitude. Thank you for being law enforcement friendly. Thank you for realizing that cops don't make a lot, and making it financially possible for me to do this. I've already applied these tactics in fights in my job. They work, and have kept me and my teammates safe.",

Never been afraid to ask a question, the coach doesn't think he knows everything and he will go out of his way to make sure your question is answered. I always feel welcome, everyone is there to learn and improve together and nobody has an ego. We're all equals just trying to improve in the sport we love. We compete in tournaments and we push each other to do the best we can and leave it all on the mat. If you're wanting to get into jiu jitsu, this is the place I would recommend every time I'm asked. Could not recommend this place enough!!",
